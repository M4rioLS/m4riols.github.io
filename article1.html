            <h1>Revisiting Old Game Projects</h1>
            <p class="post-meta article-meta">Published on March 18, 2025 by M4rioLS</p>

            <p>It's always a curious experience digging through old hard drives or code repositories. Recently, I stumbled upon a folder containing several game prototypes I'd worked on a few years back – projects ranging from simple platformers to overly ambitious RPG concepts that never saw the light of day.</p>

            <p>Opening them up felt like a form of digital archaeology. First, there was the challenge of even getting them to run! Dependencies change, engines update, and sometimes the operating system itself has moved on. Thankfully, after a bit of tinkering (and remembering how I'd set things up back then), I managed to get a couple of them working.</p>

            <h2>What I Found (Besides Bugs)</h2>
            <p>Beyond the inevitable bugs and half-implemented features, it was fascinating to see how my approach to coding and design has evolved. Some things made me cringe – messy code, questionable logic – while others sparked a flicker of recognition for an idea that still felt promising.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coding Style Evolution:</strong> My current self would definitely structure things differently now. More comments, better variable names, perhaps more object-oriented approaches where I previously used simpler scripts.</li>
                <li><strong>Forgotten Ideas:</strong> I found a mechanic in one platformer involving manipulating time locally around the player that I'd completely forgotten about. It was clunky, but the core concept felt interesting even now.</li>
                <li><strong>Scope Creep Evidence:</strong> Oh, the ambition! One project clearly suffered from trying to do too much. Seeing the scattered assets and unfinished systems was a stark reminder of the importance of managing scope.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lessons Learned (Again)</h2>
            <p>This trip down memory lane wasn't just nostalgic; it reinforced a few key takeaways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Version Control is Your Friend:</strong> Seriously. Even for small prototypes, having a history makes revisiting (and potentially salvaging) much easier.</li>
                <li><strong>Document Your Thoughts:</strong> A simple README or design notes can be invaluable years later when trying to understand *why* you made certain decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Be Afraid to Salvage:</strong> Just because a project wasn't completed doesn't mean every part of it is useless. Good ideas or useful code snippets can often be repurposed.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Overall, it was a worthwhile exercise. It's humbling to see past work, but also encouraging to recognize progress. Maybe some of those forgotten ideas will find their way into future projects in a more refined form. Have you ever revisited your old projects? What did you discover?</p>

		alarm[0] = 120;	// return to room alarm
